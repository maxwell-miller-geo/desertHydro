Check radar for what is happening with some of these events
Show in a defense for these regions - spatial patterns of these types of storms events. Image of cloud over gauges- show data and how this manifests in data.

How do you resolve that?
Pair with radar product.
Half a dozen to a dozen events. That you trust with rainfall and response 
Find better rainfall product. Besides land-cover and topography input. At the mercy of the data.

Duration of flow and maximum discharge. It might show a nice correlation, suggest an outlier events. Have plotted all gauges?

1) Know lag time - start of storm and start of flow. Some is negative. Center of mass of rain and the peak discharge
2) Duration of flow
3) Peak discharge
4) Sum up the volume of water from discharge. Total rain * area = averaging the rainfall over the areas. 
Rain gauges capture all of the water necessary.
