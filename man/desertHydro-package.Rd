\title{desertHydro: Spatially Distributed Hydrology Model for Arid Watersheds}
\description{
The desertHydro watershed model simulates the surface and shallow subsurface flow from an input rainfall event. The primary flow routing algorithm is modified from a Soil Moisture Routing (SMR) algorithm. The user inputs a digital elevation model (DEM), watershed boundary, (shapefile), soil characteristics, and precipitation data. The model outputs stacked tif files with each timestep as a layer including velocity, soil moisture, and surface depth. Optionally, these stacked rasters can be converted into gifs for visual aids. Note - This is still in early stages of development.
