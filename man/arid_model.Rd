\arguments{
\item{ModelFolder}{The designated folder path to save the outputs from the files.
The script will write and modify the elements present within the output folder.}

\item{WatershedElements}{The folder path that contains all the necessary components to
create and run the hydrological model.}

\item{demFile}{Name of the digital elevation file within WatershedElements. Defaults to "dem.tif"}

\item{date}{Optional date string. must be in format "YYYY-MM-DD".
The date will be evaluated and pull necessary event information from downloaded .csv files - rain and discharge data.
Not very flexible and is based on the formatting of the event file date columns. Uses tidyverse packages to filter date information.}

\item{boundary}{Optional: T/F: If TRUE, will crop using terra::crop datasets to boundary layer. Boundary or extent mismatches in spatial data
will prevent successful model simulations.}

\item{landCoverFile}{Optional: Default NA: Expects string format of land cover tif file e.g. "landcover.tif" that is present within the WatershedElements fold.
Note: If changed, the key parameter needs to be changed to match the category column name. See vignette for expected structure.}

\item{LandCoverCharacteristics}{Optional: Default "LandCoverCharacteristics.xlsx": Excel spreadsheet that contains
hydrological characteristics, most importantly Manning's n values for different land cover types found
within landCoverFile. Note: If input, the 'key' parameter must match attributes within land cover file, .tif or .shp, to a
column header within the excel spreadsheet.}

\item{key}{Optional: Default: "NLCD_Key" string for name of land cover types in excel table and the land cover map ".tif".
This will convert excel table hydrological characteristics into a stacked raster map with each layer corresponding to a hydrological characteristic and spatially distributed them.
See vignette for expected structure.}

\item{impervious}{Optional: T/F: If TRUE, model calculate runoff without infiltration.
Can be used to perform quicker model simulations to determine sensitivity or runoff potential.}

\item{rainfall_method}{Optional rainfall method string. Default "gauges" creates weighted average of rainfall within a given watershed.
The "gauges" data must be formatted correctly to apply rainfall. For additional options of rainfall see documenatatin for
rainfallCreate.}

\item{store}{Optional: T/F: If TRUE, will store graphs or plots in ModelFolder}

\item{gif}{Optional: T/F: If TRUE, will create gif animations for each of the typical outputs - Surface water depth, surface water velocity, and soil moisture.}

\item{discharge}{Optional: T/F: If TRUE, script will use observed discharge data -expected format ".tsv"-
to modify simulation length and create compiled hydrographs with containing predicted and observed discharges.
Expects ESRI shapefile point at gauged location named "gauges.shp" within WatershedElements folder.}

\item{time_step}{Optional based time step in fraction of minutes. Defaults to 1 minute. Recommended: 0.25 - 1 minute.
The time step is the default evaluation time step for a model.
The script will dynamically adjust the time step based on the calculated surface velocities.}

\item{simulation_length}{Optional length of simulation in minutes. Defaults to rainfall duration + discharge duration.
and reduce the size of the computational boundary. Best used for testing smaller portions of watershed.
Large computational areas + 1 million cells will take considerable time depending on the length of simulation.}

\item{overwrite}{Optional: T/F: If TRUE, overwrite elements within WatershedElements folder and ModelFolder when necessary.}

\item{write}{Optional to write outputs from model. Default = TRUE}

\item{restartModel}{Optional: T/F: If TRUE, model will attempt to restart from last recorded time and water surface elevations
Note: If files within Model Folder are edited, it may not work.}

\item{...}{Additional parameters to pass into inner functions.}
