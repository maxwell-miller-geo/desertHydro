The goal of desertHydro is to create a spatially distributed
hydrological model built with R tools!

## Installation

You can install the development version of desertHydro from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("maxwell-miller-geo/desertHydro")
```

## Expected Workflow

``` r
library(desertHydro)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`?
You can include R chunks like so:

Youâ€™ll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md`
up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.
